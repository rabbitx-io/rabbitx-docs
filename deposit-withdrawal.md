Deposits require at least 12 on-chain confirmations. Deposits typically take **3-6 minutes.** Reach out to our [support channel](https://discord.gg/yFHNDe4KDY) if you have any issues during the deposit process.

## Withdrawal

Withdrawals may take up to **12 hours** to be confirmed from Starknet to Ethereum L1. Withdrawals are a two-step process. Once a withdrawal request has been processed and ready to be claimed, it will be shown in the "Transfers" tab.

Please note the process for withdrawals:

* Your wallet balance on RabbitX will be immediately deducted by the withdrawn amount
* You will see the withdrawn amount display initially as “Pending” in your Transfers tab
* Once the withdrawal is accepted by Starknet, the status will change to “Transferring”
* In “Transferring” status, your withdrawal is now being processed by Starknet. Depending on Starknet’s block time this process currently takes up to 12 hours, with an estimated time of 6-10 hours.
* Once completed, the transfer status will change to “Success” in your Transfers tab
* You will be able to claim your requested withdrawal amount back to your wallet
