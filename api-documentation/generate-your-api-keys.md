# Generate Your API Keys

Once logged in, users can generate their API key and secret by clicking the :gear: gear icon at the top right hand side of the page. You will be asked to sign a message to generate your API keys. We recommend setting IP restrictions as a security best practice.&#x20;

Once the API key is created, you can export into a json file and save it for your trading program to be used.&#x20;

You can renew the API keys which will extend the expiry by 30 days each time.&#x20;

### How to create an API key and secret

To create an API key and secret, go to the app and click on the :gear: icon

You will then be prompted to sign a message "Welcome to Rabbit DEX" with your wallet to authenticate you. This message is safe to sign.&#x20;

You will then be prompted to create a new API key by specifying the length of expiration of the API key along with any ip restrictions that you would like to set.

Once your API key is created, you will be able to copy the API Key, Secret, Public and Private JWT tokens.&#x20;

* You will need the API Key, Secret to place orders and retrieve private data through REST
* Private JWT token for websocket private account data
* Refresh token is used to renew your keys

Note: you can renew your tokens by clicking the "Renew Now" button to renew it for 30 days.
