# Generate Your API Keys

Once logged in, users can generate their API Key/Secrets by clicking the :gear: gear icon at the top right hand side of the page. You will be asked to sign a message to generate your api keys. We recommend setting IP restrictions as a security best practice.&#x20;

Once the api key is created, you can export into a json file and save it for your trading program to be used.&#x20;

You can renew the api keys which will extend the expiry by 30 days each time.&#x20;
