**FAQs**

**Q:** How do I deposit collateral to start trading?

**A:** You must deposit USDT-ERC20 to start trading.

**Q:** Do I need to pay gas to trade?

**A:** You do not need to pay gas for trading. However, you will need to pay gas for deposits and withdrawals.

**Q:** Why am I interacting on an Ethereum if you’re using ZK tech?

**A:** Deposits and withdrawals on RabbitX are done on Ethereum layer 1. RabbitX then uses ZK technology for settlement services to handle your deposits and withdrawals. Using our L1-to-L2 link, we conveniently take care of all the backend processes for you. This is why you can use an EVM wallet with us and don’t have to use a Cairo-specific wallet.&#x20;

**Q:** Why do my market orders sometimes not immediately fill?

**A:** To protect traders from adverse price movements when executing a market order, if the execution price of a market order deviates beyond 5%, the exchange will automatically place the remaining unfilled portion of the order at 5% away from the fair price.
