### Ways to Earn

#### A. Liquidity Pool Incentives (50%)

Liquidity providers earn rGEMs by staking assets in the RabbitX Liquidity Pool Vault (RLP).

**Formula:**

* **Distribution Frequency:** Weekly
* **Key Factors:** Amount staked, duration staked (longer durations earn higher multipliers)

#### B. Trading Rewards (50%)

Traders earn rGEMs based on their trading activity, incentivizing both position size and duration.

**Formula:**

* **Snapshot Frequency:** Every 1 minute
* **Qualifying Criteria:** Positions must be open for more than 1 minute to avoid wash trading
* **Reward Dynamics:** Larger positions and longer durations earn greater rewards

#### C. Active Trader Multiplier

Daily activity compounds your trading rewards through an escalating multiplier:

* Day 1: **1x**
* Day 2: **1.25x**
* Day 3: **1.5x**
* Day 4: **1.75x**
* Day 5+: **2x**

**Note:** Missing a trading day resets your streak and multiplier. This multiplier applies solely to trading rewards, not liquidity rewards.
