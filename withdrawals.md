# Withdrawals

Withdrawals are a two-step process. In order to complete a withdrawal, users must claim their withdrawal from "Transfers".

Safety and security is the highest priority for RabbitX. For security, we require more blocks to process larger withdrawal transactions based on the withdrawal amounts below.

| Withdrawal Amount (USD) | Processing Blocks |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- |
| 0-9,999                 | 1                 |
| 10,000                  | 10                |
| 100,000                 | 100               |
| 1,000,000+              | 1800              |
