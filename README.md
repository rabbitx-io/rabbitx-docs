## Key Features

### :tada: Trade for Free&#x20;

Trade Bitcoin and other markets for free, with no fees! We‚Äôve cut out the middlemen so that anyone can trade without fees. Our game-changing business model allows everyday investors and traders to save thousands in fees.

### 0Ô∏è‚É£**Gasless Deposits: Onboarding Without the Friction**

RabbitX removes one of the most common barriers in crypto: network fees. With **gasless deposits and withdrawals**, users can move assets in and out of the platform without paying gas, no matter the underlying blockchain. This is particularly valuable for new users who might not hold native tokens like ETH or ARB to cover fees. By abstracting away these costs, RabbitX creates a seamless experience that feels closer to using a traditional fintech app than a DeFi protocol. It‚Äôs ideal for both first-timers and power users who want to move fast without operational drag.

### **üí∏ AMM Vault: High-Yield Earnings on Stablecoins**

For users looking to earn yield without active trading, the **RabbitX AMM Vault** offers a powerful alternative. Designed to generate **over 60% APY** in stablecoin returns, the vault taps into trading activity across the platform to deliver consistent, high-yield returns. Users deposit stablecoins, and the vault automatically allocates liquidity into AMM pools that fuel RabbitX‚Äôs decentralized order book. Unlike speculative yield farms, the vault focuses on sustainable returns powered by real trading volume and fees. It‚Äôs an ideal place to park idle funds and earn passively‚Äîno active management or exposure to volatile assets required.
