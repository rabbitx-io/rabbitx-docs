## Our History

Founded in 2021, RabbitX brought together a seasoned team of skilled builders, accomplished derivatives traders, and billion-dollar portfolio managers. Originally launched as Strips Finance‚Äîa decentralised interest rate swaps exchange on Arbitrum‚Äîthe team soon expanded its mission and vision and rebranded as RabbitX. The focus shifted from creating solely decentralized interest rate derivatives to building a comprehensive suite of derivatives for every single global asset class.&#x20;

From inception, the RabbitX team has remained dedicated to a first-principles approach to product development, emphasising a robust risk engine, trader-centric design, and equipping traders with powerful, innovative tools.

RabbitX is backed by the biggest and most successful investors in the world, including Sequoia Capital US, Peak XV Partners (previously Sequoia India), Multicoin Capital, Crypto.com, OKX Ventures and more.

## Features

### Unparalleled Speed ‚ö°

You like to live life fast, we do too. That's why we're one of the fastest decentralised exchanges in the world.

RabbitX is based on a unique hybrid orderbook composition. RabbitX combines the speed and efficiency of an off-chain orderbook with the security of on-chain settlements. We are able to achieve millisecond latency that is up to **50x faster** than any other onchain derivatives platform.&#x20;

RabbitX is built on Starknet, the highly scalable blockchain based on ZK-rollup technology. Starknet operates as a layer-2 network over Ethereum, enabling any dApp to achieve unlimited scale of computation. On Starknet, it is cryptographically impossible to have fraudulent transactions (not the case with Optimistic Rollups), and the chain inherits the full security of Ethereum layer 1.

### Security üîí

RabbitX is built on the most secure network in crypto, Ethereum. If Ethereum is secure, we are secure. RabbitX transactions are settled on the layer-2 Starknet before being securely broadcasted on layer-1 Ethereum. This enables scaling without making any sacrifices to security.

### No Front Running üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

RabbitX operates independently and is not owned by any market-making firms. Trade with peace of mind knowing that RabbitX will never front-run your orders.&#x20;

### Zero Gas Fees 0Ô∏è‚É£

No more gas fees. Our game-changing hybrid exchange enables real-time trading without paying a single dollar in gas fees. Place limit, market and stop orders instantly.&#x20;
