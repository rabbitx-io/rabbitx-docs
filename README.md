## Features

### Unparalleled Speed ‚ö°

You like to live life fast, we do too. That's why we're one of the fastest decentralized exchanges in the world.

Rabbit<mark style="color:red;">X</mark> is based on a unique hybrid orderbook composition. Rabbit<mark style="color:red;">X</mark> combines the speed and efficiency of an offchain orderbook, with the security of onchain settlements. We are able to achieve milliseconds latency that is up to <mark style="color:red;">50x faster</mark> than any other onchain derivatives platform.&#x20;

Rabbit<mark style="color:red;">X</mark> is built on Starknet, the highly scalable blockchain based on ZK-rollup technology. Starknet operates as a layer-2 network over Ethereum, enabling any dApp to achieve unlimited scale of computation. On Starknet, it is cryptographically impossible to have fraudulent transactions (not the case with Optimistic Rollups) and the chain inherits the full security of Ethereum layer 1.

### Security üîí

Rabbit<mark style="color:red;">X</mark> is built on the most secure network in crypto, Ethereum. If Ethereum is secure, we are secure. Rabbit<mark style="color:red;">X</mark> transactions are settled on the layer-2 Starknet before being securely broadcasted on layer-1 Ethereum. This enables scaling without any sacrifices to security. Read more about [Starknet](https://starkware.co/starknet/) and [ZK-STARK](https://starkware.co/stark/) technology.&#x20;

### No Front Running üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
