# Frequently Asked Questions

### What are ZK Rollups?

ZK Rollups refers to zero-knowledge rollups, a concept conceived of in 1985 and now the premiere and best means of scaling Ethereum. ZK rollups are a hybrid scaling solution on the Ethereum mainnet that increases throughput and lowers transaction costs. **ZK-rollups** bundle (or 'roll up') transactions into batches that are executed offchain. Offchain computation reduces the amount of data that has to be posted to the blockchain. ZK-rollup operators submit a summary of the changes required to represent all the transactions in a batch rather than sending each transaction individually.&#x20;
